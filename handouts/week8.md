# Final projects
## Pre-proposal
> Intended to promote early thought, the pre-proposal is your opportunity to bounce one or more ideas off of your teaching fellow. Quite simply, by this pre-proposal's deadline, send an email to your teaching fellow, CCing projects@cs50.harvard.edu, **describing one or more ideas that you have for your final project**. Short, casual emails are fine, but do explain the motivation behind each of your ideas (i.e., **why it interests you**). Treat this requirement as an **opportunity for counsel**. Certainly include any questions or concerns that you have in this email. The subject line of your email should be Pre-Proposal

Due by email to me on Mon. 11/2!
