# How to prepare

In order of most useful to least useful:

* Do practice tests: <https://cs50.harvard.edu/quizzes>.
* Review old section handouts at <https://github.com/hathix/cs50-section/tree/master/handouts>. Focus on redoing the challenge problems.
* Check out class-wide review sessions, e.g. <http://cs50.tv/2013/fall/quizzes/0/> or  <http://cdn.cs50.net/2013/fall/quizzes/0/review0.pdf>.
* Review <https://study.cs50.net/>
* Watch some shorts.

# What to include on your cheat sheet

* Big-O complexity of searches and sorts
* Sizes (in bytes) of data types
* The headers of various functions, e.g. `int strlen(char*)`. You might need to use these.
* Common error messages and what causes them
