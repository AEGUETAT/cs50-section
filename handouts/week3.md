## pset2 tips
`style50` will make sure your style is OK. It's great at catching dumb syntax mistakes, so use it whenever you get strange compilation errors. And, of course, use it before you submit!

```sh
style50 my-file.c
```

`check50` will run tests to make sure your program gives the expected output when given some input. Make sure your program passes all of its tests before you submit! Most psets have a check50; check the pset spec to find them!
