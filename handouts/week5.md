## strlen (Fall 2013 Quiz 0)

Suppose that you've also forgotten which header file declares `strlen`, and so you need to re-implement it yourself (even if you didn't just use it). Bah. Even worse, neither `[` nor `]` currently works on your keyboard (or pencil or pen).  Without calling any functions at all  and without using any square brackets, complete the implementation of `strlen` below  using pointer arithmetic in such a way that the function returns the length of `s`. If `s` happens to be `NULL`, your implementation of `strlen` should return 0.

Solution: <http://cdn.cs50.net/2013/fall/quizzes/0/key0.pdf>.

```c
int strlen(char* s)
{

























}
```
