# Neel Mehta's fall 2015 CS50 section

*[This is CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu), Harvard University's introduction to computer science. It's also Harvard's largest course, with over 700 undergrads and 600,000 students on edX. As a teaching fellow, I lead a section!*

Here you can find the following resources from my section:

* Code examples, challenge problems, and the solutions thereto.
* Handouts with code samples, concept reviews, challenge problems, problem set tips, and useful links.
* Slides with similar content as the handouts.
